          <p>Let's dive in.</p>

          <p>Pozole is a traditional Mexican soup or stew that has deep cultural roots, often enjoyed during
            celebrations and special occasions, such as New Year's, Independence Day, and other festivities. The dish is
            known for its hearty and comforting qualities, combining a rich, flavorful broth with hominy (dried maize
            that has been treated with lime), meat, and a variety of toppings.</p>

      <p>Beyond the Basics: How to Create Puerto Rican Dishes That Wow Your Tastebuds.</p>

      <p>Habichuelas Guisadas is a staple dish in Puerto Rican cuisine, typically served as a side dish alongside rice
        and meat. It consists of red beans (habichuelas rojas) cooked in a rich, flavorful sauce made with spices,
        tomato, and a blend of seasonings, giving it a comforting, hearty taste. The beans are stewed until tender and
        absorb all the delicious seasonings.</p>
      <p>Tostones are a popular Puerto Rican snack or side dish made from green plantains (unripe plantains). They are
        crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, offering a delicious contrast of textures. These fried plantains
        are typically served with a dipping sauce or as a side to meats and rice.</p>
      <p>Bistec Encebollado is a classic Puerto Rican dish consisting of marinated steak served with a savory and
        flavorful onion sauce. The dish is comforting and full of robust flavors, with the sweetness of the caramelized
        onions complementing the savory steak.</p>
